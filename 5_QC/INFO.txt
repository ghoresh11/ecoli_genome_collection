Things that need to be run for QC:

1. Beep (BIN):
- removes too many contigs
- removes wrong lengths
- removes according to mash distance of species cutoff

2. Use Kraken outputs to remove isolates that are likely not E. coli

3. Use quality control outputs to check how many reads were mapped,
see the distribution and choose what to remove

4. heterozigosity percent (would show two alleles in one place suggesting there is a contamination)
Also look at the distribution and decide what to remove
