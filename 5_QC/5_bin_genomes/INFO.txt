This is the output of running the "bin" command to apply
MASH to filter out
1. Genomes that are probably not from the same species
2. Genomes with two many contigs
3. Genomes that have lengths that vary too much from the expected length
of an E. coli genome

I applied beep bin twice (on the GFF files and ASSEMBLIES)
I should be getting equivalent outputs.

The params: 
max_contigs = 600
min_length = 4MBP
max_length = 6MBP
species_cutoff = 0.04
distance = 0.005

The number of genomes in the "gff" file is how many I started with
Remove contaminants (not correct species) and qc (number of contigs/length wrong)
