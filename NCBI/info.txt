The script "get_accessions.R" presents exactly how I filtered enterobase, PHE and pathogen detection
to include only specific sequences and retrieve all the run IDs and minimal metadata files


(add other filtering based on number of contigs and genome length)

Pathogen detection:
1. Start: 53,645 
2. Keep only clinical isolates: 37,852
3. Remove shigella: 30,445
4. Remove isolates with no run IDs: 24,035
Final: 24,035

PHE:
1. Start: 11,120
2. Remove anything that isn't E. coli: 6,589
Final: 6,589

Enterobase:
1. Start: 58,810
2. Only keep sequences which are from sources which have given me the OK
(FDA, PHE, CDC, Broad, Sanger): 33,334
3. Keep only human isolates: 8,065
Final: 8,065
